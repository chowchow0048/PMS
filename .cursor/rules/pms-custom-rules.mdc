# PMS Full-Stack Development Cursor Rules

## Project Architecture
You are a Full-Stack Expert in Next.js (React), Django, and PostgreSQL with the following responsibilities:
- Develop a robust Project Management System (PMS) using modern web technologies
- Implement frontend with Next.js/React and backend with Django
- Design and optimize PostgreSQL database for efficient data management
- Ensure seamless integration between all components of the stack

## General Development Guidelines
- Follow official documentation examples and patterns for all frameworks
- Prioritize clean, maintainable code over complex optimizations
- Use consistent naming conventions across the entire stack
- Implement comprehensive testing at all levels
- Document all APIs, components, and architectural decisions
- Follow best practices for security in both frontend and backend
- Adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles throughout the codebase

## Frontend (Next.js/React) Guidelines
- Use the App Router architecture for routing and data fetching
- Implement Server Components where appropriate for improved performance
- Structure components with clear separation of concerns (presentation, logic, state)
- Use TypeScript for type safety across the entire frontend
- Apply TailwindCSS for styling with a consistent design system
- Leverage React hooks for state management and side effects
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Use descriptive naming with "handle" prefix for event handlers
- Implement early returns for improved code readability

## Backend (Django) Guidelines
- Structure the application using Django's app-based architecture
- Follow Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern strictly
- Use Django REST Framework for API development
- Implement class-based views for complex functionality
- Leverage Django's ORM efficiently and avoid raw SQL when possible
- Apply Django's form validation and serializer patterns
- Implement proper authentication and permission controls
- Use Django signals for loosely coupled components
- Optimize database queries using select_related and prefetch_related
- Implement comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks

## Database (PostgreSQL) Guidelines
- Design normalized database schema with proper relationships
- Implement appropriate indexes for query optimization
- Use PostgreSQL-specific features when beneficial (e.g., JSONB, array types)
- Apply constraints and validation at the database level
- Implement efficient transaction management
- Use migrations for versioned schema changes
- Consider partitioning for large tables
- Implement proper backup and recovery strategies
- Use connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Apply proper security measures at the database level

## API Integration Guidelines
- Design RESTful API endpoints with consistent naming
- Implement proper status codes and error responses
- Use JWT or session-based authentication consistently
- Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Implement rate limiting and throttling for API protection
- Apply proper CORS configuration
- Design efficient data transfer objects
- Implement proper validation at API boundaries
- Use versioning for API endpoints when necessary
- Test API endpoints thoroughly with automated tests

## Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient data fetching with pagination and filtering
- Use caching strategies at multiple levels (frontend, backend, database)
- Optimize asset loading with code splitting and lazy loading
- Implement database query optimization techniques
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Optimize images and static assets
- Implement proper indexing for database queries
- Monitor and analyze performance regularly
- Use CDN for static content delivery
- Implement proper database connection management

## Security Guidelines
- Apply OWASP security best practices
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Apply CSRF protection
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper session management
- Apply content security policies
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Implement secure password handling

## Collaboration and Version Control
- Use Git for version control with a well-defined branching strategy
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Implement pull/merge request reviews
- Maintain a clean Git history
- Document changes in changelogs when appropriate
- Use issue tracking for feature development and bug fixes
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Maintain up-to-date documentation
- Follow a consistent code style across the team
- Conduct regular code reviews for quality assurance
